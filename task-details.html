            <h4>What is it?</h4>
            <p> Birthday Cal is a 7-day calendar which tells you the day (Mon/Tue/Wed...Sun) a person's birthday falls on for a specific year.</p>

            <h4>How does it work?</h4>
            <p>Given a list of birthdays and the year as input, the Birthday Cal shows the name of the person under the correct day in the calendar. </p>
            <p>
              Say, you have a list of people:
            </p>
            <pre>
 A = 2/15/1978
 B = 5/23/1983</pre>
            <p>
              and user selects the year as "<strong>2015</strong>".
            </p>
            <p>
              Since A's birthday in 2015 falls on Sunday (because 2/15/2015 is Sunday) and
              B's birthday falls on Saturday (because 5/23/2015 is Saturday).
            </p>

            <p>
              On the calendar, you have to put A in Sunday's box. And B in Saturday's box.
            </p>

            <h4>Task Details</h4>
            <p>The birthday list will be entered in a
              JSON format within textarea. The year will be selected from
              a dropdown.
            </p>

            <p>You need to process the given JSON input and place people's initials in the card according to these rules:
            </p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>If the box is empty, it should add the day--empty class to the box.</li>
                <li>Add name as title attribute for each box of a card.</li>
                <li>Each person must always be rendered as square.</li>
                <li>Order people inside the card based on their age (youngest to oldest).</li>
                <li>Each square in a card must be of equal size and fit
                them in such a way that every person occupies maximum area.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>How it works?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>On initial load calendar should show result for selected year.</li>
              <li>Year change should update the birthday calendar.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Here's an example of how the complete calendar would look like:</strong>
              <img class="intro__example" src="img/display-final.png" />
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="intro__helpers">
            <p>
              <h3>Submitting your work:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Don't use any external JS library.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You may use Sass/LESS for CSS.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
